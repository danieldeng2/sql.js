// https://github.com/kripken/emscripten/issues/5820
// In addition, When you use emcc's modularization, it still expects to export a global object called `Module`,
// which is able to be used/called before the WASM is loaded.
// The modularization below exports a promise that loads and resolves to the actual sql.js module.
// That way, this module can't be used before the WASM is finished loading.

// We are going to define a function that a user will call to start loading initializing our Sql.js library
// However, that function might be called multiple times, and on subsequent calls, we don't actually want it to instantiate a new instance of the Module
// Instead, we want to return the previously loaded module

        // 1) We undefine `module`
        // 2) We remember what `module['exports']` was at the beginning of this function and we restore it later
        // 3) We write a script to remove those lines of code as part of the Make process.
        //
        // Since those are the only lines of code that care about module, we will undefine it. It's the most straightforward
        // of the options, and has the side effect of reducing emcc's efforts to modify the module if its output were to change in the future.
        // That's a nice side effect since we're handling the modularization efforts ourselves
